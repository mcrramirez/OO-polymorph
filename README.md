# OO-polymorph
In JavaScript, you can use polymorphism to implement role-based access control by defining different classes or objects that represent roles and granting or denying access based on the specific role of a user. 
In this example, we have three roles (Guest, Member, and Admin) represented by classes. 
The User class takes a role as a parameter, and the checkAccess method is used to check the access rights based on the user's role. 
This demonstrates how polymorphism allows users with different roles to access content differently, even when using the same method name (accessContent).
